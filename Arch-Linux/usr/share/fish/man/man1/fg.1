.SH NAME
fg \- bring job to foreground
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBfg\fP [\fIPID\fP]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBfg\fP builtin brings the specified \fI\%job\fP to the foreground, resuming it if it is stopped.
While a foreground job is executed, fish is suspended.
If no job is specified, the last job to be used is put in the foreground.
If \fBPID\fP is specified, the job containing a process with the specified process ID is put in the foreground.
.sp
For compatibility with other shells, job expansion syntax is supported for \fBfg\fP\&. A \fIPID\fP of the format \fB%1\fP will foreground job 1.
Job numbers can be seen in the output of \fI\%jobs\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB\-\-help\fP or \fB\-h\fP option displays help about using this command.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
\fBfg\fP will put the last job in the foreground.
.sp
\fBfg %3\fP will put job 3 into the foreground.

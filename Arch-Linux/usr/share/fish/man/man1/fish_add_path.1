\fBfish_add_path\fP [(\fB\-g\fP | \fB\-\-global\fP) | (\fB\-U\fP | \fB\-\-universal\fP) | (\fB\-P\fP | \fB\-\-path\fP)] [(\fB\-m\fP | \fB\-\-move\fP)] [(\fB\-a\fP | \fB\-\-append\fP) | (\fB\-p\fP | \fB\-\-prepend\fP)] [(\fB\-v\fP | \fB\-\-verbose\fP) | (\fB\-n\fP | \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP)] \fIPATHS\fP \&...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBfish_add_path\fP is a simple way to add more components to fish\(aqs \fI\%PATH\fP\&. It does this by adding the components either to $fish_user_paths or directly to \fI\%PATH\fP (if the \fB\-\-path\fP switch is given).
.sp
It is (by default) safe to use \fBfish_add_path\fP in config.fish, or it can be used once, interactively, and the paths will stay in future because of \fI\%universal variables\fP\&. This is a \(dqdo what I mean\(dq style command, if you need more control, consider modifying the variable yourself.
.sp
Components are normalized by \fI\%realpath\fP\&. Trailing slashes are ignored and relative paths are made absolute (but symlinks are not resolved). If a component already exists, it is not added again and stays in the same place unless the \fB\-\-move\fP switch is given.
.sp
Components are added in the order they are given, and they are prepended to the path unless \fB\-\-append\fP is given (if $fish_user_paths is used, that means they are last in $fish_user_paths, which is itself prepended to \fI\%PATH\fP, so they still stay ahead of the system paths).
.sp
If no component is new, the variable (\fI\%fish_user_paths\fP or \fI\%PATH\fP) is not set again or otherwise modified, so variable handlers are not triggered.
.sp
If a component is not an existing directory, \fBfish_add_path\fP ignores it.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-append\fP
Add components to the \fIend\fP of the variable.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-prepend\fP
Add components to the \fIfront\fP of the variable (this is the default).
.TP
\fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP
Use a global \fI\%fish_user_paths\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-U\fP or \fB\-\-universal\fP
Use a universal \fI\%fish_user_paths\fP \- this is the default if it doesn\(aqt already exist.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP or \fB\-\-path\fP
Manipulate \fI\%PATH\fP directly.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-move\fP
Move already\-existing components to the place they would be added \- by default they would be left in place and not added again.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP or \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Print the \fI\%set\fP command used.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP
Print the \fBset\fP command that would be used without executing it.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
Displays help about using this command.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fB\-\-move\fP is used, it may of course lead to the path swapping order, so you should be careful doing that in config.fish.

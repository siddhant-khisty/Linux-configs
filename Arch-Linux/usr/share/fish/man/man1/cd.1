.SH NAME
cd \- change directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcd\fP [\fIDIRECTORY\fP]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcd\fP changes the current working directory.
.sp
If \fIDIRECTORY\fP is given, it will become the new directory. If no parameter is given, the \fI\%HOME\fP environment variable will be used.
.sp
If \fIDIRECTORY\fP is a relative path, all the paths in the \fI\%CDPATH\fP will be tried as prefixes for it, in addition to \fI\%PWD\fP\&.
It is recommended to keep \fB\&.\fP as the first element of \fI\%CDPATH\fP, or \fI\%PWD\fP will be tried last.
.sp
Fish will also try to change directory if given a command that looks like a directory (starting with \fB\&.\fP, \fB/\fP or \fB~\fP, or ending with \fB/\fP), without explicitly requiring \fBcd\fP\&.
.sp
Fish also ships a wrapper function around the builtin \fBcd\fP that understands \fBcd \-\fP as changing to the previous directory.
See also \fI\%prevd\fP\&.
This wrapper function maintains a history of the 25 most recently visited directories in the \fB$dirprev\fP and \fB$dirnext\fP global variables.
If you make those universal variables your \fBcd\fP history is shared among all fish instances.
.sp
As a special case, \fBcd .\fP is equivalent to \fBcd $PWD\fP, which is useful in cases where a mountpoint has been recycled or a directory has been removed and recreated.
.sp
The \fB\-\-help\fP or \fB\-h\fP option displays help about using this command, and does not change the directory.

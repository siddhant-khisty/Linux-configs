.IP \(bu 2
By default, \fBControl\-R\fP now opens the command history in the pager (\fI\%#602\fP). This is fully searchable and syntax\-highlighted, as an alternative to the incremental search seen in other shells. The new special input function \fBhistory\-pager\fP has been added for custom bindings.

.UNINDENT

For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function multicd
    echo cd (string repeat \-n (math (string length \-\- $argv[1]) \- 1) ../)
end

abbr \-\-add dotdot \-\-regex \(aq^\e.\e.+$\(aq \-\-function multicd
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This expands \fB\&..\fP to \fBcd ../\fP, \fB\&...\fP to \fBcd ../../\fP and \fB\&....\fP to \fBcd ../../../\fP and so on.
.sp
Or:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C
function last_history_item; echo $history[1]; end
abbr \-a !! \-\-position anywhere \-\-function last_history_item
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which expands \fB!!\fP to the last history item, anywhere on the command line, mimicking other shells\(aq history expansion.
.sp
See \fI\%the documentation\fP for more.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpath\fP gained a new \fBmtime\fP subcommand to print the modification time stamp for files. For example, this can be used to handle cache file ages (\fI\%#9057\fP):
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> touch foo
> sleep 10

.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP gained a new \fBshorten\fP subcommand to shorten strings to a given visible width (\fI\%#9156\fP):
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

\fBtest\fP (aka \fB[\fP) gained \fB\-ot\fP (older than) and \fB\-nt\fP (newer than) operators to compare file modification times, and \fB\-ef\fP to compare whether the arguments are the same file (\fI\%#3589\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish will now mark the extent of many errors with a squiggly line, instead of just a caret (\fB^\fP) at the beginning (\fI\%#9130\fP). For example:
.INDENT 2.0

.IP \(bu 2
\fBstatus\fP gained a new subcommand, \fBcurrent\-commandline\fP, which retrieves the entirety of the currently\-executing command line when called from a function during execution. This allows easier job introspection (\fI\%#8905\fP, \fI\%#9296\fP).
.UNINDENT

.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\ex\fP and \fB\eX\fP escape syntax is now equivalent. \fB\exAB\fP previously behaved the same as \fB\eXAB\fP, except that it would error if the value \(dqAB\(dq was larger than \(dq7f\(dq (127 in decimal, the highest ASCII value) (\fI\%#9247\fP, \fI\%#9245\fP, \fI\%#1352\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_git_prompt\fP will now only turn on features if the appropriate variable has been set to a true value (of \(dq1\(dq, \(dqyes\(dq or \(dqtrue\(dq) instead of just checking if it is defined. This allows specifically turning features \fIoff\fP without having to erase variables, such as via universal variables. If you have defined a variable to a different value and expect it to count as true, you need to change it (\fI\%#9274\fP).
For example, \fBset \-g __fish_git_prompt_show_informative_status 0\fP previously would have enabled informative status (because any value would have done so), but now it turns it off.
.IP \(bu 2
Abbreviations are no longer stored in universal variables. Existing universal abbreviations are still imported, but new abbreviations should be added to \fBconfig.fish\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2

If the terminal definition for \fI\%TERM\fP can\(aqt be found, fish now tries using the \(dqxterm\-256color\(dq and \(dqxterm\(dq definitions before \(dqansi\(dq and \(dqdumb\(dq. As the majority of terminal emulators in common use are now more or less xterm\-compatible (often even explicitly claiming the xterm\-256color entry), this should often result in a fully or almost fully usable terminal (\fI\%#9026\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new variable, \fI\%fish_cursor_selection_mode\fP, can be used to configure whether the command line selection includes the character under the cursor (\fBinclusive\fP) or not (\fBexclusive\fP). The new default is \fBexclusive\fP; use \fBset fish_cursor_selection_mode inclusive\fP to get the previous behavior back (\fI\%#7762\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish\(aqs completion pager now fills half the terminal on first tab press instead of only 4 rows, which should make results visible more often and save key presses, without constantly snapping fish to the top of the terminal (\fI\%#9105\fP, \fI\%#2698\fP).
.IP \(bu 2

\fBAlt\-H\fP (the default \fB__fish_man_page\fP binding) does a better job of showing the manual page of the command under cursor (\fI\%#9020\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
If \fI\%fish_color_valid_path\fP contains an actual color instead of just modifiers, those will be used for valid paths even if the underlying color isn\(aqt \(dqnormal\(dq (\fI\%#9159\fP).

The key combination for the QUIT terminal sequence, often \fBControl\-Backslash\fP (\fB\ex1c\fP), can now be sused as a binding (\fI\%#9234\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish\(aqs vi mode uses normal xterm\-style sequences to signal cursor change, instead of using the iTerm\(aqs proprietary escape sequences. This allows for a blinking cursor and makes it work in complicated scenarios with nested terminals. (\fI\%#3741\fP, \fI\%#9172\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
When running fish on a remote system (such as inside SSH or a container), \fBControl\-X\fP now copies to the local client system\(aqs clipboard if the terminal supports OSC 52.

.SS Deprecations and removed features
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBstderr\-nocaret\fP feature flag, introduced in fish 3.0 and enabled by default in fish 3.1, has been made read\-only.
That means it is no longer possible to disable it, and code supporting the \fB^\fP redirection has been removed (\fI\%#8857\fP, \fI\%#8865\fP).
.sp
To recap: fish used to support \fB^\fP to redirect stderr, so you could use commands like:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
test \(dq$foo\(dq \-gt 8 ^/dev/null
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to ignore error messages. This made the \fB^\fP symbol require escaping and quoting, and was a bit of a weird shortcut considering \fB2>\fP already worked, which is only one character longer.
.sp
So the above can simply become:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
test \(dq$foo\(dq \-gt 8 2>/dev/null
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
The following feature flags have been enabled by default:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBregex\-easyesc\fP, which makes \fBstring replace \-r\fP not do a superfluous round of unescaping in the replacement expression.
That means e.g. to escape any \(dqa\(dq or \(dqb\(dq in an argument you can use \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e$1\(aq foobar\fP instead of needing 8 backslashes.
.sp
This only affects the \fIreplacement\fP expression, not the \fImatch\fP expression (the \fB\(aq([ab])\(aq\fP part in the example).
A survey of plugins on GitHub did not turn up any affected code, so we do not expect this to affect many users.
.sp
This flag was introduced in fish 3.1.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP, which means that \fB&\fP will not create a background job if it occurs in the middle of a word. For example, \fBecho foo&bar\fP will print \(dqfoo&bar\(dq instead of running \fBecho foo\fP in the background and then starting \fBbar\fP as a second job.
.sp
Reformatting with \fBfish_indent\fP would already introduce spaces, turning \fBecho foo&bar\fP into \fBecho foo & bar\fP\&.
.sp
This flag was introduced in fish 3.4.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To turn off these flags, add \fBno\-regex\-easyesc\fP or \fBno\-ampersand\-nobg\-in\-token\fP to \fBfish_features\fP and restart fish:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set \-Ua fish_features no\-regex\-easyesc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Like \fBstderr\-nocaret\fP, they will eventually be made read\-only.
.IP \(bu 2
Most \fBstring\fP subcommands no longer append a newline to their input if the input didn\(aqt have one (\fI\%#8473\fP, \fI\%#3847\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Fish\(aqs escape sequence removal (like for \fBstring length \-\-visible\fP or to figure out how wide the prompt is) no longer has special support for non\-standard color sequences like from Data General terminals, e.g. the Data General Dasher D220 from 1984. This removes a bunch of work in the common case, allowing \fBstring length \-\-visible\fP to be much faster with unknown escape sequences. We don\(aqt expect anyone to have ever used fish with such a terminal (\fI\%#8769\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Code to upgrade universal variables from fish before 3.0 has been removed. Users who upgrade directly from fish versions 2.7.1 or before will have to set their universal variables & abbreviations again. (\fI\%#8781\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
The meaning of an empty color variable has changed (\fI\%#8793\fP). Previously, when a variable was set but empty, it would be interpreted as the \(dqnormal\(dq color. Now, empty color variables cause the same effect as unset variables \- the general highlighting variable for that type is used instead. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set \-g fish_color_command blue
set \-g fish_color_keyword
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
would previously make keywords \(dqnormal\(dq (usually white in a dark terminal). Now it\(aqll make them blue. To achieve the previous behavior, use the normal color explicitly: \fBset \-g fish_color_keyword normal\fP\&.
.sp
This makes it easier to make self\-contained color schemes that don\(aqt accidentally use color that was set before.
\fBfish_config\fP has been adjusted to set known color variables that a theme doesn\(aqt explicitly set to empty.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBeval\fP is now a reserved keyword, so it can\(aqt be used as a function name. This follows \fBset\fP and \fBread\fP, and is necessary because it can\(aqt be cleanly shadowed by a function \- at the very least \fBeval set \-l argv foo\fP breaks. Fish will ignore autoload files for it, so left over \fBeval.fish\fP from previous fish versions won\(aqt be loaded.
.IP \(bu 2
The git prompt in informative mode now defaults to skipping counting untracked files, as this was extremely slow. To turn it on, set \fB__fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles\fP or set the git config value \(dqbash.showuntrackedfiles\(dq to \fBtrue\fP explicitly (which can be done for individual repositories). The \(dqinformative+vcs\(dq sample prompt already skipped display of untracked files, but didn\(aqt do so in a way that skipped the computation, so it should be quite a bit faster in many cases (\fI\%#8980\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB__terlar_git_prompt\fP function, used by the \(dqTerlar\(dq sample prompt, has been rebuilt as a configuration of the normal \fBfish_git_prompt\fP to ease maintenance, improve performance and add features (like reading per\-repo git configuration). Some slight changes remain; users who absolutely must have the same behavior are encouraged to copy the old function (\fI\%#9011\fP, \fI\%#7918\fP, \fI\%#8979\fP).

Specifying an initial tab to \fBfish_config\fP now only works with \fBfish_config browse\fP (eg \fBfish_config browse variables\fP), otherwise it would interfere with the new \fBprompt\fP subcommand (see below) (\fI\%#7958\fP).

\fBmath\fP gained new functions \fBlog2\fP (like the documentation claimed), \fBmax\fP and \fBmin\fP (\fI\%#7856\fP). \fBmath\fP functions can be used without the parentheses (eg \fBmath sin 2 + 6\fP), and functions have the lowest precedence in the order of operations (\fI\%#7877\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Shebang (\fB#!\fP) lines are no longer required within shell scripts, improving support for scripts with concatenated binary contents. If a file fails to execute and passes a (rudimentary) binary safety check, fish will re\-invoke it using \fB/bin/sh\fP (\fI\%#7802\fP).

Exit codes are better aligned with bash. A failed execution now reports \fB$status\fP of 127 if the file is not found, and 126 if it is not executable.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBecho\fP no longer writes its output one byte at a time, improving performance and allowing use with Linux\(aqs special API files (\fB/proc\fP, \fB/sys\fP and such) (\fI\%#7836\fP).

fish produces more specific errors when a command in a command substitution wasn\(aqt found or is not allowed. This now prints something like \(dqUnknown command\(dq instead of \(dqUnknown error while evaluating command substitution\(dq.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent\fP allows inline variable assignments (\fBFOO=BAR command\fP) to use line continuation, instead of joining them into one line (\fI\%#7955\fP).

fish gained a \fB\-\-no\-config\fP option to disable configuration files. This applies to user\-specific and the systemwide \fBconfig.fish\fP (typically in \fB/etc/fish/config.fish\fP), and configuration snippets (typically in \fBconf.d\fP directories). It also disables universal variables, history, and loading of functions from system or user configuration directories (\fI\%#7921\fP, \fI\%#1256\fP).

.IP \(bu 2
Performance of the \(dqinformative\(dq git prompt is improved somewhat (\fI\%#7871\fP). This is still slower than the non\-informative version by its very nature. In particular it is IO\-bound, so it will be very slow on slow disks or network mounts.
.IP \(bu 2
The sample prompts were updated. Some duplicated prompts, like the various classic variants, or less useful ones, like the \(dqjustadollar\(dq prompt were removed, some prompts were cleaned up, and in some cases renamed. A new \(dqsimple\(dq and \(dqdisco\(dq prompt were added (\fI\%#7884\fP, \fI\%#7897\fP, \fI\%#7930\fP). The new prompts will only take effect when selected and existing installed prompts will remain unchanged.
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBprompt_login\fP helper function to describe the kind of \(dqlogin\(dq (user, host and chroot status) for use in prompts. This replaces the old \(dqdebian chroot\(dq prompt and has been added to the default and terlar prompts (\fI\%#7932\fP).

.SH FISH 3.2.1 (RELEASED MARCH 18, 2021)
.sp
This release of fish fixes the following problems identified in fish 3.2.0:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands in key bindings are run with fish\(aqs internal terminal modes, instead of the terminal modes typically used for commands. This fixes a bug introduced in 3.2.0, where text would unexpectedly appear on the terminal, especially when pasting (\fI\%#7770\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Prompts which use the internal \fB__fish_print_pipestatus\fP function will display correctly rather than carrying certain modifiers (such as bold) further than intended (\fI\%#7771\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Redirections to internal file descriptors is allowed again, reversing the changes in 3.2.0. This fixes a problem with Midnight Commander (\fI\%#7769\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Universal variables should be fully reliable regardless of operating system again (\fI\%#7774\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_git_prompt\fP no longer causes screen flickering in certain terminals (\fI\%#7775\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_add_path\fP manipulates the \fBfish_user_paths\fP variable correctly when moving multiple paths (\fI\%#7776\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Pasting with a multi\-line command no longer causes a \fB__fish_tokenizer_state\fP error (\fI\%#7782\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpsub\fP inside event handlers cleans up temporary files properly (\fI\%#7792\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Event handlers declared with \fB\-\-on\-job\-exit $fish_pid\fP no longer run constantly (\fI\%#7721\fP), although these functions should use \fB\-\-on\-event fish_exit\fP instead.
.IP \(bu 2
Changing terminal modes inside \fBconfig.fish\fP works (\fI\%#7783\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset_color \-\-print\-colors\fP no longer prints all colors in bold (\fI\%#7805\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Completing commands starting with a \fB\-\fP no longer prints an error (\fI\%#7809\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Running \fBfish_command_not_found\fP directly no longer produces an error on macOS or other OSes which do not have a handler available (\fI\%#7777\fP).

\fBfish completes ambiguous completions\fP after pressing \fBTab\fP even when they
have a common prefix, without the user having to press \fBTab\fP again
(\fI\%#6924\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish is less aggressive about resetting terminal modes, such as flow control, after every command.
Although flow control remains off by default, enterprising users can now enable it with
\fBstty\fP (\fI\%#2315\fP, \fI\%#7704\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fB\(dqfish_add_path\(dq helper function to add paths to $PATH\fP without producing duplicates,
to be used interactively or in \fBconfig.fish\fP (\fI\%#6960\fP, \fI\%#7028\fP).

.ft C
fish_add_path /opt/mycoolthing/bin
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish \-\-no\-execute\fP \fBwill no longer complain about unknown commands\fP
or non\-matching wildcards, as these could be defined differently at
runtime (especially for functions). This makes it usable as a static syntax checker (\fI\%#977\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring match \-\-regex\fP now integrates \fBnamed PCRE2 capture groups as fish variables\fP, allowing variables to be set directly from \fBstring match\fP (\fI\%#7459\fP). To support this functionality, \fBstring\fP is now a reserved word and can no longer be wrapped in a function.
.IP \(bu 2
Globs and other \fBexpansions are limited to 512,288 results\fP (\fI\%#7226\fP). Because operating systems limit the number of arguments to commands, larger values are unlikely to work anyway, and this helps to avoid hangs.
.IP \(bu 2

\fBset\fP and backgrounded jobs no longer overwrite \fB$pipestatus\fP (\fI\%#6820\fP), improving its use in command substitutions (\fI\%#6998\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Computed (\(dqelectric\(dq) variables such as \fBstatus\fP are now only global in scope, so \fBset \-Uq status\fP returns false (\fI\%#7032\fP).

background job stops or ends, or any job terminates from a signal (\fI\%#6959\fP, \fI\%#2727\fP, \fI\%#4319\fP).
The default behaviour can now be customized by redefining it.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstatus\fP gained new \fBdirname\fP and \fBbasename\fP convenience subcommands
to get just the directory to the running script or the name of it,
to simplify common tasks such as running \fB(dirname (status filename))\fP (\fI\%#7076\fP, \fI\%#1818\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Broken pipelines are now handled more smoothly; in particular, bad redirection mid\-pipeline
results in the job continuing to run but with the broken file descriptor replaced with a closed
file descriptor. This allows better error recovery and is more in line with other shells\(aq

.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now passes the validation variables (e.g. \fB$_flag_value\fP) as local\-exported variables,
avoiding the need for \fB\-\-no\-scope\-shadowing\fP in validation functions.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete\fP takes the first argument as the name of the command if the \fB\-\-command\fP/\fB\-c\fP option is not used,
so \fBcomplete git\fP is treated like \fBcomplete \-\-command git\fP,
and it can show the loaded completions for specific commands with \fBcomplete COMMANDNAME\fP (\fI\%#7321\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset_color \-b\fP (without an argument) no longer prints an error message, matching other invalid invocations of this command (\fI\%#7154\fP).

The interactive reader now allows ending a line in a logical operators (\fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP) instead of complaining about a missing command. (This was already syntactically valid, but interactive sessions didn\(aqt know about it yet).
.IP \(bu 2
The prompt is reprinted after a background job exits (\fI\%#1018\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer inserts a space after a completion ending in \fB\&.\fP, \fB,\fP or \fB\-\fP is accepted, improving completions for tools that provide dynamic completions (\fI\%#6928\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
If a filename is invalid when first pressing \fBTab\fP, but becomes valid, it will be completed properly on the next attempt (\fI\%#6863\fP).

\fBhelp string match/replace/<subcommand>\fP will show the help for string subcommands (\fI\%#6786\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_key_reader\fP sets the exit status to 0 when used with \fB\-\-help\fP or \fB\-\-version\fP (\fI\%#6964\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_key_reader\fP and \fBfish_indent\fP send output from \fB\-\-version\fP to standard output, matching other fish binaries (\fI\%#6964\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new variable \fB$status_generation\fP is incremented only when the previous command produces an exit status (\fI\%#6815\fP). This can be used, for example, to check whether a failure status is a holdover due to a background job, or actually produced by the last run command.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_greeting\fP is now a function that reads a variable of the same name, and defaults to setting it globally.
This removes a universal variable by default and helps with updating the greeting.
However, to disable the greeting it is now necessary to explicitly specify universal scope (\fBset \-U fish_greeting\fP) or to disable it in config.fish (\fI\%#7265\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Events are properly emitted after a job is cancelled (\fI\%#2356\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_preexec\fP and \fBfish_postexec\fP events are no longer triggered for empty commands (\fI\%#4829\fP, \fI\%#7085\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Functions triggered by the \fBfish_exit\fP event are correctly run when the terminal is closed or the shell receives SIGHUP (\fI\%#7014\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_prompt\fP event no longer fires when \fBread\fP is used. If
you need a function to run any time \fBread\fP is invoked by a script,
use the new \fBfish_read\fP event instead (\fI\%#7039\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fBfish_posterror\fP event is emitted when attempting to execute a command with syntax errors (\fI\%#6880\fP, \fI\%#6816\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The debugging system has now fully switched from the old numbered level to the new named category system introduced in 3.1. A number of new debugging categories have been added, including \fBconfig\fP, \fBpath\fP, \fBreader\fP and \fBscreen\fP (\fI\%#6511\fP). See the output of \fBfish \-\-print\-debug\-categories\fP for the full list.
.IP \(bu 2
The warning about read\-only filesystems has been moved to a new \(dqwarning\-path\(dq debug category
and can be disabled by setting a debug category of \fB\-warning\-path\fP (\fI\%#6630\fP):

The enabled debug categories are now printed on shell startup (\fI\%#7007\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fB\-o\fP short option to fish, for \fB\-\-debug\-output\fP, works correctly instead of producing an
invalid option error (\fI\%#7254\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish\(aqs debugging can now also be enabled via \fBFISH_DEBUG\fP and \fBFISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT\fP environment variables.
This helps with debugging when no commandline options can be passed, like when fish is called in a shebang (\fI\%#7359\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Abbreviations are now expanded after all command terminators (eg \fB;\fP or \fB|\fP), not just space,
as in fish 2.7.1 and before (\fI\%#6970\fP), and after closing a command substitution (\fI\%#6658\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The history file is now created with user\-private permissions,
matching other shells (\fI\%#6926\fP). The directory containing the history
file was already private, so there should not have been any private data
revealed.
.IP \(bu 2
The output of \fBtime\fP is now properly aligned in all cases (\fI\%#6726\fP, \fI\%#6714\fP) and no longer depends on locale (\fI\%#6757\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The command\-not\-found handling has been simplified.
When it can\(aqt find a command, fish now just executes a function called \fBfish_command_not_found\fP
instead of firing an event, making it easier to replace and reason about.
Previously\-defined \fB__fish_command_not_found_handler\fP functions with an appropriate event listener will still work (\fI\%#7293\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBControl\-C\fP handling has been reimplemented in C++ and is therefore quicker (\fI\%#5259\fP), no longer occasionally prints an \(dqunknown command\(dq error (\fI\%#7145\fP) or overwrites multiline prompts (\fI\%#3537\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBControl\-C\fP no longer kills background jobs for which job control is
disabled, matching POSIX semantics (\fI\%#6828\fP, \fI\%#6861\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Autosuggestions work properly after \fBControl\-C\fP cancels the current commmand line (\fI\%#6937\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
History search is now case\-insensitive unless the search string contains an uppercase character (\fI\%#7273\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_update_completions\fP gained a new \fB\-\-keep\fP option, which improves speed by skipping completions that already exist (\fI\%#6775\fP, \fI\%#6796\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Aliases containing an embedded backslash appear properly in the output of \fBalias\fP (\fI\%#6910\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBopen\fP no longer hangs indefinitely on certain systems, as a bug in \fBxdg\-open\fP has been worked around (\fI\%#7215\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Long command lines no longer add a blank line after execution (\fI\%#6826\fP) and behave better with \fBBackspace\fP (\fI\%#6951\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions \-t\fP works like the long option \fB\-\-handlers\-type\fP, as documented, instead of producing an error (\fI\%#6985\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
History search now flashes when it found no more results (\fI\%#7362\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
fish now creates the path in the environment variable \fBXDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fP if it does not exist, before using it for runtime data storage (\fI\%#7335\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset_color \-\-print\-colors\fP now also respects the bold, dim, underline, reverse, italic and background modifiers, to better show their effect (\fI\%#7314\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fish Web configuration tool (\fBfish_config\fP) shows prompts correctly on Termux for Android (\fI\%#7298\fP) and detects Windows Services for Linux 2 properly (\fI\%#7027\fP). It no longer shows the \fBhistory\fP variable as it may be too large (one can use the History tab instead). It also starts the browser in another thread, avoiding hangs in some circumstances, especially with Firefox\(aqs Developer Edition (\fI\%#7158\fP). Finally, a bug in the Source Code Pro font may cause browsers to hang, so this font is no longer chosen by default (\fI\%#7714\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfuncsave\fP gained a new \fB\-\-directory\fP option to specify the location of the saved function (\fI\%#7041\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp\fP works properly on MSYS2 (\fI\%#7113\fP) and only uses \fBcmd.exe\fP if running on WSL (\fI\%#6797\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Resuming a piped job by its number, like \fBfg %1\fP, works correctly (\fI\%#7406\fP). Resumed jobs show the correct title in the terminal emulator (\fI\%#7444\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Commands run from key bindings now use the same TTY modes as normal commands (\fI\%#7483\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Autosuggestions from history are now case\-sensitive (\fI\%#3978\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$status\fP from completion scripts is no longer passed outside the completion, which keeps the status display in the prompt as the last command\(aqs status (\fI\%#7555\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Updated localisations for pt_BR (\fI\%#7480\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_trace\fP output now starts with \fB\->\fP (like \fBfish \-\-profile\fP), making the depth more visible (\fI\%#7538\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Resizing the terminal window no longer produces a corrupted prompt (\fI\%#6532\fP, \fI\%#7404\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions\fP produces an error rather than crashing on certain invalid arguments (\fI\%#7515\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A crash in completions with inline variable assignment (eg \fBA= b\fP) has been fixed (\fI\%#7344\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_private_mode\fP may now be changed dynamically using \fBset\fP (\fI\%#7589\fP), and history is kept in memory in private mode (but not stored permanently) (\fI\%#7590\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Commands with leading spaces may be retrieved from history with up\-arrow until a new command is run, matching zsh\(aqs \fBHIST_IGNORE_SPACE\fP (\fI\%#1383\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Importing bash history or reporting errors with recursive globs (\fB**\fP) no longer hangs (\fI\%#7407\fP, \fI\%#7497\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbind\fP now shows \fB\ex7f\fP for the del key instead of a literal DEL character (\fI\%#7631\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Paths containing variables or tilde expansion are only suggested when they are still valid (\fI\%#7582\fP).

Syntax highlighting can now color a command as invalid even if executed quickly (\fI\%#5912\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Redirection targets are no longer highlighted as error if they contain variables which will likely be defined by the current commandline (\fI\%#6654\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish is now more resilient against broken terminal modes (\fI\%#7133\fP, \fI\%#4873\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish handles being in control of the TTY without owning its own process group better, avoiding some hangs in special configurations (\fI\%#7388\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Keywords can now be colored differently by setting the \fBfish_color_keyword\fP variable (\fBfish_color_command\fP is used as a fallback) (\fI\%#7678\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Just like \fBfish_indent\fP, the interactive reader will indent continuation lines that follow a line ending in a backslash, \fB|\fP, \fB&&\fP or \fB||\fP (\fI\%#7694\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Commands with a trailing escaped space are saved in history correctly (\fI\%#7661\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_prompt\fP no longer mangles Unicode characters in the private\-use range U+F600\-U+F700. (\fI\%#7723\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The universal variable file, \fBfish_variables\fP, can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten (\fI\%#7466\fP).

A new special input function \fBforward\-single\-char\fP moves one character to the right, and if an autosuggestion is available, only take a single character from it (\fI\%#7217\fP, \fI\%#4984\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Special input functions can now be joined with \fBor\fP as a modifier (adding to \fBand\fP), though only some commands set an exit status (\fI\%#7217\fP). This includes \fBsuppress\-autosuggestion\fP to reflect whether an autosuggestion was suppressed (\fI\%#1419\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
A new function \fB__fish_preview_current_file\fP, bound to \fBAlt+O\fP, opens the

.IP \(bu 2
\fBgit\fP completions can complete the right and left parts of a commit range like \fBfrom..to\fP or \fBleft...right\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Completion scripts for custom Git subcommands like \fBgit\-xyz\fP are now loaded with Git completions. The completions can now be defined directly on the subcommand (using \fBcomplete git\-xyz\fP), and completion for \fBgit xyz\fP will work. (\fI\%#7075\fP, \fI\%#7652\fP, \fI\%#4358\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmake\fP completions no longer second\-guess make\(aqs file detection, fixing target completion in some cases (\fI\%#7535\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Command completions now correctly print the description even if the command was fully matched (like in \fBls<TAB>\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBset\fP completions no longer hide variables starting with \fB__\fP, they are sorted last instead.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Improvements to the manual page completion generator (\fI\%#7086\fP, \fI\%#6879\fP, \fI\%#7187\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Significant performance improvements to completion of the available commands (\fI\%#7153\fP), especially on macOS Big Sur where there was a significant regression (\fI\%#7365\fP, \fI\%#7511\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Suffix completion using \fB__fish_complete_suffix\fP uses the same fuzzy matching logic as normal file completion, and completes any file but sorts files with matching suffix first (\fI\%#7040\fP, \fI\%#7547\fP). Previously, it only completed files with matching suffix.

.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_command_not_found\fP event is no longer emitted, instead there is a function of that name.
By default it will call a previously\-defined \fB__fish_command_not_found_handler\fP\&. To emit the event manually use \fBemit fish_command_not_found\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_prompt\fP event no longer fires when \fBread\fP is used. If
you need a function to run any time \fBread\fP is invoked by a script,
use the new \fBfish_read\fP event instead (\fI\%#7039\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
To disable the greeting message permanently it is no longer enough to just run \fBset fish_greeting\fP interactively as it is
no longer implicitly a universal variable. Use \fBset \-U fish_greeting\fP or disable it in config.fish with \fBset \-g fish_greeting\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The long\-deprecated and non\-functional \fB\-m\fP/\fB\-\-read\-mode\fP options to \fBread\fP were removed in 3.1b1. Using the short form, or a never\-implemented \fB\-B\fP option, no longer crashes fish (\fI\%#7659\fP).

The default values for the \fBextra_completionsdir\fP, \fBextra_functionsdir\fP
and \fBextra_confdir\fP options now use the installation prefix rather than \fB/usr/local\fP (\fI\%#6778\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new CMake variable \fBFISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2\fP controls whether fish
builds with the system\-installed PCRE2, or the version it bundles. By
default it prefers the system library if available, unless Mac
codesigning is enabled (\fI\%#6952\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Running the full interactive test suite now requires Python 3.5+ and the pexpect package (\fI\%#6825\fP); the expect package is no longer required.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands which involve \fB\&. ( ... | psub)\fP now work correctly, as a
bug in the \fBfunction \-\-on\-job\-exit\fP option has been fixed (\fI\%#6613\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Conflicts between upstream packages for ripgrep and bat, and the fish
packages, have been resolved (\fI\%#5822\fP).

Starting fish in a directory without read access, such as via \fBsu\fP,
no longer crashes (\fI\%#6597\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Glob ordering changes which were introduced in 3.1.0 have been
reverted, returning the order of globs to the previous state (\fI\%#6593\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Redirections using the deprecated caret syntax to a file descriptor
(eg \fB^&2\fP) work correctly (\fI\%#6591\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Redirections that append to a file descriptor (eg \fB2>>&1\fP) work
correctly (\fI\%#6614\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Building fish on macOS (\fI\%#6602\fP) or with new versions of GCC (\fI\%#6604\fP,
\fI\%#6609\fP) is now successful.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtime\fP is now correctly listed in the output of \fBbuiltin \-n\fP, and
\fBtime \-\-help\fP works correctly (\fI\%#6598\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Exported universal variables now update properly (\fI\%#6612\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstatus current\-command\fP gives the expected output when used with
an environment override \- that is, \fBF=B status current\-command\fP
returns \fBstatus\fP instead of \fBF=B\fP (\fI\%#6635\fP).

\fBtest\fP no longer crashes when used with “\fBnan\fP” or “\fBinf\fP”
arguments, erroring out instead (\fI\%#6655\fP).
.IP \(bu 2

(\fI\%#6680\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP no longer removes multiple separators when splitting a
variable into a list, restoring the previous behaviour from fish 3.0
and before (\fI\%#6650\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Functions using \fB\-\-on\-job\-exit\fP and \fB\-\-on\-process\-exit\fP work
reliably again (\fI\%#6679\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Functions using \fB\-\-on\-signal INT\fP work reliably in interactive
sessions, as they did in fish 2.7 and before (\fI\%#6649\fP). These handlers
have never worked in non\-interactive sessions, and making them work
is an ongoing process.
.IP \(bu 2
Functions using \fB\-\-on\-variable\fP work reliably with variables which
are set implicitly (rather than with \fBset\fP), such as
“\fBfish_bind_mode\fP” and “\fBPWD\fP” (\fI\%#6653\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were
incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 (\fB$TERM\fP begins with xterm, does
not include “\fB256color\fP”, and \fB$TERM_PROGRAM\fP is not set)
(\fI\%#6701\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The Mercurial (\fBhg\fP) prompt no longer produces an error when the
current working directory is removed (\fI\%#6699\fP). Also, for performance
reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the
detailed status, set \fB$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The VCS prompt, \fBfish_vcs_prompt\fP, no longer displays Subversion
(\fBsvn\fP) status by default, due to the potential slowness of this
operation (\fI\%#6681\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Pasting of commands has been sped up (\fI\%#6713\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non\-Unicode
capable locale (such as the \fBC\fP or \fBPOSIX\fP locale) no longer
renders all output blank (\fI\%#6736\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBhelp\fP prefers to use \fBxdg\-open\fP, avoiding the use of \fBopen\fP on
Debian systems where this command is actually \fBopenvt\fP (\fI\%#6739\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history,
now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight
Commander integration (\fI\%#6763\fP), but may be changed in a future
version.
.IP \(bu 2
Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of
the content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (\fI\%#6927\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfzf\fP in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as
part of command substitutions or \fBeval\fP will no longer have
separate process groups. (\fI\%#6624\fP, \fI\%#6806\fP).

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new \fB$pipestatus\fP variable contains a list of exit statuses of
the previous job, for each of the separate commands in a pipeline
(\fI\%#5632\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish no longer buffers pipes to the last function in a pipeline,
improving many cases where pipes appeared to block or hang (\fI\%#1396\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
An overhaul of error messages for builtin commands, including a
removal of the overwhelming usage summary, more readable stack traces
(\fI\%#3404\fP, \fI\%#5434\fP), and stack traces for \fBtest\fP (aka \fB[\fP) (\fI\%#5771\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish’s debugging arguments have been significantly improved. The
\fB\-\-debug\-level\fP option has been removed, and a new \fB\-\-debug\fP
option replaces it. This option accepts various categories, which may
be listed via \fBfish \-\-print\-debug\-categories\fP (\fI\%#5879\fP). A new
\fB\-\-debug\-output\fP option allows for redirection of debug output.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring\fP has a new \fBcollect\fP subcommand for use in command
substitutions, producing a single output instead of splitting on new
lines (similar to \fB\(dq$(cmd)\(dq\fP in other shells) (\fI\%#159\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fish manual, tutorial and FAQ are now available in \fBman\fP format
as \fBfish\-doc\fP, \fBfish\-tutorial\fP and \fBfish\-faq\fP respectively
(\fI\%#5521\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Like other shells, \fBcd\fP now always looks for its argument in the
current directory as a last resort, even if the \fBCDPATH\fP variable
does not include it or “.” (\fI\%#4484\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
fish now correctly handles \fBCDPATH\fP entries that start with \fB\&..\fP
(\fI\%#6220\fP) or contain \fB\&./\fP (\fI\%#5887\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBfish_trace\fP variable may be set to trace execution (\fI\%#3427\fP).
This performs a similar role as \fBset \-x\fP in other shells.
.IP \(bu 2
fish uses the temporary directory determined by the system, rather
than relying on \fB/tmp\fP (\fI\%#3845\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The fish Web configuration tool (\fBfish_config\fP) prints a list of
commands it is executing, to help understanding and debugging
(\fI\%#5584\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Major performance improvements when pasting (\fI\%#5866\fP), executing lots
of commands (\fI\%#5905\fP), importing history from bash (\fI\%#6295\fP), and when
completing variables that might match \fB$history\fP (\fI\%#6288\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS Syntax changes and new commands
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new builtin command, \fBtime\fP, which allows timing of fish
functions and builtins as well as external commands (\fI\%#117\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a “,” or a
variable expansion, meaning common commands such as
\fBgit reset HEAD@{0}\fP do not require escaping (\fI\%#5869\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
New redirections \fB&>\fP and \fB&|\fP may be used to redirect or pipe
stdout, and also redirect stderr to stdout (\fI\%#6192\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBswitch\fP now allows arguments that expand to nothing, like empty
variables (\fI\%#5677\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBVAR=val cmd\fP syntax can now be used to run a command in a
modified environment (\fI\%#6287\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBand\fP is no longer recognised as a command, so that nonsensical
constructs like \fBand and and\fP produce a syntax error (\fI\%#6089\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP‘s exponent operator,’\fB^\fP‘, was previously
left\-associative, but now uses the more commonly\-used
right\-associative behaviour (\fI\%#6280\fP). This means that
\fBmath \(aq3^0.5^2\(aq\fP was previously calculated as’(3\s-2\u0.5)\d\s02’,
but is now calculated as ‘3\s-2\u(0.5\d\s02)’.
.IP \(bu 2
In fish 3.0, the variable used with \fBfor\fP loops inside command
substitutions could leak into enclosing scopes; this was an
inadvertent behaviour change and has been reverted (\fI\%#6480\fP).

\fBbuiltin $var\fP now works correctly, allowing a variable as the
builtin name (\fI\%#5639\fP).

\fBcd\fP understands the \fB\-\-\fP argument to make it possible to change
to directories starting with a hyphen (\fI\%#6071\fP).

\fBeval\fP produces an exit status of 0 when given no arguments, like
other shells (\fI\%#5692\fP).

\fBcomplete \-Cfoo\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcomplete\fP has a new \fB\-\-force\-files\fP option, to re\-enable file
completions. This allows \fBsudo \-E\fP and \fBpacman \-Qo\fP to complete
correctly (\fI\%#5646\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP now defaults to showing the current function name
(instead of \fBargparse\fP) in its errors, making \fB\-\-name\fP often
superfluous (\fI\%#5835\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBargparse\fP has a new \fB\-\-ignore\-unknown\fP option to keep
unrecognized options, allowing multiple argparse passes to parse
options (\fI\%#5367\fP).

\fBargparse\fP correctly handles flag value validation of options that
only have short names (\fI\%#5864\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread \-S\fP (short option of \fB\-\-shell\fP) is recognised correctly
(\fI\%#5660\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP understands \fB\-\-list\fP, which acts like \fB\-\-array\fP in
reading all arguments into a list inside a single variable, but is
better named (\fI\%#5846\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP has a new option, \fB\-\-tokenize\fP, which splits a string into
variables according to the shell’s tokenization rules, considering
quoting, escaping, and so on (\fI\%#3823\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP interacts more correctly with the deprecated \fB$IFS\fP
variable, in particular removing multiple separators when splitting a
variable into a list (\fI\%#6406\fP), matching other shells.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent\fP now handles semicolons better, including leaving them
in place for \fB; and\fP and \fB; or\fP instead of breaking the line
(\fI\%#5859\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfish_indent \-\-write\fP now supports multiple file arguments,
indenting them in turn.
.IP \(bu 2
The default read limit has been increased to 100MiB (\fI\%#5267\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP now also understands \fBx\fP for multiplication, provided it
is followed by whitespace (\fI\%#5906\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmath\fP reports the right error when incorrect syntax is used inside
parentheses (\fI\%#6063\fP), and warns when unsupported logical operations
are used (\fI\%#6096\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions \-\-erase\fP now also prevents fish from autoloading a
function for the first time (\fI\%#5951\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBjobs \-\-last\fP returns 0 to indicate success when a job is found
(\fI\%#6104\fP).

\fBcommandline \-p\fP and \fBcommandline \-j\fP now split on \fB&&\fP and
\fB||\fP in addition to \fB;\fP and \fB&\fP (\fI\%#6214\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where \fBstring split\fP would drop empty strings if the output
was only empty strings has been fixed (\fI\%#5987\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBeval\fP no long creates a new local variable scope, but affects
variables in the scope it is called from (\fI\%#4443\fP). \fBsource\fP still
creates a new local scope.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBabbr\fP has a new \fB\-\-query\fP option to check for the existence of
an abbreviation.
.IP \(bu 2
Local values for \fBfish_complete_path\fP and \fBfish_function_path\fP
are now ignored; only their global values are respected.
.IP \(bu 2
Syntax error reports now display a marker in the correct position
(\fI\%#5812\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Empty universal variables may now be exported (\fI\%#5992\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Exported universal variables are no longer imported into the global
scope, preventing shadowing. This makes it easier to change such
variables for all fish sessions and avoids breakage when the value is
a list of multiple elements (\fI\%#5258\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where \fBfor\fP could use invalid variable names has been fixed
(\fI\%#5800\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A bug where local variables would not be exported to functions has
been fixed (\fI\%#6153\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The null command (\fB:\fP) now always exits successfully, rather than
passing through the previous exit status (\fI\%#6022\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The output of \fBfunctions FUNCTION\fP matches the declaration of the
function, correctly including comments or blank lines (\fI\%#5285\fP), and
correctly includes any \fB\-\-wraps\fP flags (\fI\%#1625\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtype\fP supports a new option, \fB\-\-short\fP, which suppress function
expansion (\fI\%#6403\fP).

\fBtype \-\-force\-path\fP with an argument that cannot be found now
correctly outputs nothing, as documented (\fI\%#6411\fP).

the bash implementation (\fI\%#5637\fP) and avoiding changes to path ordering
in child shells (\fI\%#5456\fP). It now ignores blank lines like the bash

The locale is now reloaded when the \fBLOCPATH\fP variable is changed
(\fI\%#5815\fP).

as documented when universal variables are used for its stack
(\fI\%#5797\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunced\fP and the edit\-commandline\-in\-buffer bindings did not work
in fish 3.0 when the \fB$EDITOR\fP variable contained spaces; this has

starting the private session will prevent the warning about history
not being saved from being printed (\fI\%#6299\fP).

__fish_vcs_prompt is now fish_vcs_prompt, __fish_hg_prompt is now
fish_hg_prompt and __fish_svn_prompt is now fish_svn_prompt. Shims
at the old names have been added, and the variables have kept their
old names (\fI\%#5586\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstring replace\fP has an additional round of escaping in the
replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes
(eg \fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e\e\e\e$1\(aq a\fP). The new feature
flag \fBregex\-easyesc\fP can be used to disable this, so that the same
effect can be achieved with
\fBstring replace \-ra \(aq([ab])\(aq \(aq\e\e\e\e$1\(aq a\fP (\fI\%#5556\fP). As a reminder,
the intention behind feature flags is that this will eventually

\fBfish/vendor_completions.d\fP, \fBfish/vendor_functions.d\fP, and

.sp
Since the beta release of fish 2.6b1, fish version 2.6.0 contains a
number of minor fixes, new completions for \fBmagneto\fP (\fI\%#4043\fP), and
improvements to the documentation.

Apple macOS Sierra 10.12.5 introduced a problem with launching web
browsers from other programs using AppleScript. This affects the fish
Web configuration (\fBfish_config\fP); users on these platforms will
need to manually open the address displayed in the terminal, such as
by copying and pasting it into a browser. This problem will be fixed
with macOS 10.12.6.

Jobs running in the background can now be removed from the list of
jobs with the new \fBdisown\fP builtin, which behaves like the same

.IP \(bu 2
Performance improvements in launching processes, including major
reductions in signal blocking. Although this has been heavily tested,
it may cause problems in some circumstances; set the
\fBFISH_NO_SIGNAL_BLOCK\fP variable to 0 in your fish configuration
file to return to the old behaviour (\fI\%#2007\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Performance improvements in prompts and functions that set lots of
colours (\fI\%#3793\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
The Delete key no longer deletes backwards (a regression in 2.5.0).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunctions\fP supports a new \fB\-\-details\fP option, which identifies
where the function was loaded from (\fI\%#3295\fP), and a
\fB\-\-details \-\-verbose\fP option which includes the function
description (\fI\%#597\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP will read up to 10 MiB by default, leaving the target
variable empty and exiting with status 122 if the line is too long.
You can set a different limit with the \fBFISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT\fP
variable.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBread\fP supports a new \fB\-\-silent\fP option to hide the characters
typed (\fI\%#838\fP), for when reading sensitive data from the terminal.
\fBread\fP also now accepts simple strings for the prompt (rather than
scripts) with the new \fB\-P\fP and \fB\-\-prompt\-str\fP options (\fI\%#802\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexport\fP and \fBsetenv\fP now understand colon\-separated \fBPATH\fP,
\fBCDPATH\fP and \fBMANPATH\fP variables.

\fBbind\fP supports a new \fB\-\-list\-modes\fP option (\fI\%#3872\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbg\fP will check all of its arguments before backgrounding any jobs;
any invalid arguments will cause a failure, but non\-existent (eg

New versions of ncurses (6.0 and up) wipe terminal scrollback buffers
with certain commands; the \fBC\-l\fP binding tries to avoid this
(\fI\%#2855\fP).

Some systems’ \fBsu\fP implementations do not set the \fBUSER\fP
environment variable; it is now reset for root users (\fI\%#3916\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
Under terminals which support it, bracketed paste is enabled,
escaping problematic characters for security and convience (\fI\%#3871\fP).
Inside single quotes (\fB\(aq\fP), single quotes and backslashes in pasted
text are escaped (\fI\%#967\fP). The \fBfish_clipboard_paste\fP function (bound
to \fBC\-v\fP by default) is still the recommended pasting method where
possible as it includes this functionality and more.
.IP \(bu 2
Processes in pipelines are no longer signalled as soon as one command
in the pipeline has completed (\fI\%#1926\fP). This behaviour matches other
shells mre closely.

.SH FISH 2.5B1 (RELEASED JANUARY 14, 2017)
.SS Platform Changes
.sp
Starting with version 2.5, fish requires a more up\-to\-date version of
C++, specifically C++11 (from 2011). This affects some older platforms:
.SS Linux
.sp
For users building from source, GCC’s g++ 4.8 or later, or LLVM’s clang
3.3 or later, are known to work. Older platforms may require a newer
compiler installed.
.sp
Unfortunately, because of the complexity of the toolchain, binary
packages are no longer published by the fish\-shell developers for the
following platforms:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 5 & 6 for 64\-bit builds
.IP \(bu 2
Ubuntu 12.04 (EoLTS April 2017)
.IP \(bu 2
Debian 7 (EoLTS May 2018)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Installing newer version of fish on these systems will require building
from source.
.SS OS X SnowLeopard
.sp
Starting with version 2.5, fish requires a C++11 standard library on OS
X 10.6 (“SnowLeopard”). If this library is not installed, you will see
this error: \fBdyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib\fP
.sp
MacPorts is the easiest way to obtain this library. After installing the
SnowLeopard MacPorts release from the install page, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sudo port \-v install libcxx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now fish should launch successfully. (Please open an issue if it does
not.)
.sp
This is only necessary on 10.6. OS X 10.7 and later include the required
library by default.
.SS Other significant changes
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Attempting to exit with running processes in the background produces
a warning, then signals them to terminate if a second attempt to exit
is made. This brings the behaviour for running background processes
into line with stopped processes. (\fI\%#3497\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrandom\fP can now have start, stop and step values specified, or the
new \fBchoice\fP subcommand can be used to pick an argument from a list
(\fI\%#3619\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
A new key bindings preset, \fBfish_hybrid_key_bindings\fP, including
all the Emacs\-style and Vi\-style bindings, which behaves like
\fBfish_vi_key_bindings\fP in fish 2.3.0 (\fI\%#3556\fP).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfunction\fP now returns an error when called with invalid options,
rather than defining the function anyway (\fI\%#3574\fP). This was a

.SH FISH 2.1.2 (RELEASED FEB 24, 2015)
.sp
fish 2.1.2 contains a workaround for a filesystem bug in Mac OS X
Yosemite. \fI\%#1859\fP
.sp
Specifically, after installing fish 2.1.1 and then rebooting, “Verify
Disk” in Disk Utility will report “Invalid number of hard links.” We
don’t have any reports of data loss or other adverse consequences. fish
2.1.2 avoids triggering the bug, but does not repair an already affected
filesystem. To repair the filesystem, you can boot into Recovery Mode
and use Repair Disk from Disk Utility. Linux and versions of OS X prior
to Yosemite are believed to be unaffected.

\fBTab completions will fuzzy\-match files.\fP \fI\%#568\fP

When tab\-completing a file, fish will first attempt prefix matches
(\fBfoo\fP matches \fBfoobar\fP), then substring matches (\fBooba\fP

\fBCommand substitutions now modify \(ga\(ga$status\(ga\(ga :issue:\(ga547\(ga.\fP Previously the
exit status of command substitutions (like \fB(pwd)\fP) was ignored;
however now it modifies $status. Furthermore, the \fBset\fP command now
only sets $status on failure; it is untouched on success. This allows
for the following pattern:

\fBAutosuggestions\fP\&. Think URL fields in browsers. When you type a
command, fish will suggest the rest of the command after the cursor,
in a muted gray when possible. You can accept the suggestion with the
right arrow key or Ctrl\-F. Suggestions come from command history,
completions, and some custom code for cd; there’s a lot of potential
for improvement here. The suggestions are computed on a background
pthread, so they never slow down your typing. The autosuggestion
feature is incredible. I miss it dearly every time I use anything
else.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBterm256 support\fP where available, specifically modern xterms and
OS X Lion. You can specify colors the old way (‘set_color cyan’) or
by specifying RGB hex values (‘set_color FF3333’); fish will pick the
closest supported color. Some xterms do not advertise term256 support
either in the $TERM or terminfo max_colors field, but nevertheless
support it. For that reason, fish will default into using it on any
xterm (but it can be disabled with an environment variable).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBWeb\-based configuration\fP page. There is a new function
‘fish_config’. This spins up a simple Python web server and opens a
browser window to it. From this web page, you can set your shell
colors and view your functions, variables, and history; all changes
apply immediately to all running shells. Eventually all configuration
ought to be supported via this mechanism (but in addition to, not
instead of, command line mechanisms).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMan page completions\fP\&. There is a new function
‘fish_update_completions’. This function reads all the man1 files
from your manpath, removes the roff formatting, parses them to find
the commands and options, and outputs fish completions into
~/.config/fish/completions. It won’t overwrite existing completion
files (except ones that it generated itself).

fish is now entirely in C++. I have no particular love for C++, but
it provides a ready memory\-model to replace halloc. We’ve made an
effort to keep it to a sane and portable subset (no C++11, no boost,
no going crazy with templates or smart pointers), but we do use the
STL and a little tr1.
.IP \(bu 2
halloc is entirely gone, replaced by normal C++ ownership semantics.
If you don’t know what halloc is, well, now you have two reasons to
be happy.
.IP \(bu 2
All the crufty C data structures are entirely gone. array_list_t,
priority_queue_t, hash_table_t, string_buffer_t have been removed and
replaced by STL equivalents like std::vector, std::map, and
std::wstring. A lot of the string handling now uses std::wstring
instead of wchar_t *
.IP \(bu 2
fish now spawns pthreads for tasks like syntax highlighting that
require blocking I/O.
.IP \(bu 2
History has been completely rewritten. History files now use an
extensible YAML\-style syntax. History “merging” (multiple shells
writing to the same history file) now works better. There is now a
maximum history length of about 250k items (256 * 1024).

fish now runs syntax highlighting in a background thread, so typing
commands is always responsive even on slow filesystems.
.IP \(bu 2
echo, test, and pwd are now builtins, which eliminates many forks.
.IP \(bu 2
The files in share/functions and share/completions now get
‘internalized’ into C strings that get compiled in with fish. This
substantially reduces the number of files touched at startup. A
consequence is that you cannot change these functions without
recompiling, but often other functions depend on these “standard”
functions, so changing them is perhaps not a good idea anyways.

The large number of forks relative to bash are due to fish’s insanely
expensive default prompt, which is unchanged in my version. If we switch
to a prompt comparable to bash’s (lame) default, the forks drop to 16
with trunk, 4 after our changes.
.sp
The large reduction in lstat() numbers is due to fish no longer needing
to call ttyname() on OS X.
.sp
We’ve got some work to do to be as lean as bash, but we’re on the right
track.

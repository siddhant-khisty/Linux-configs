.TH "STRING-JOIN" "1" "Mar 25, 2023" "3.6" "fish-shell"
.SH NAME
string-join \- join strings with delimiter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBstring\fP \fBjoin\fP [\fB\-q\fP | \fB\-\-quiet\fP] \fISEP\fP [\fISTRING\fP \&...]
\fBstring\fP \fBjoin0\fP [\fB\-q\fP | \fB\-\-quiet\fP] [\fISTRING\fP \&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBstring join\fP joins its \fISTRING\fP arguments into a single string separated by \fISEP\fP, which can be an empty string. Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise. If \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-\-no\-empty\fP is specified, empty strings are excluded from consideration (e.g. \fBstring join \-n + a b \(dq\(dq c\fP would expand to \fBa+b+c\fP not \fBa+b++c\fP).
.sp
\fBstring join0\fP joins its \fISTRING\fP arguments into a single string separated by the zero byte (NUL), and adds a trailing NUL. This is most useful in conjunction with tools that accept NUL\-delimited input, such as \fBsort \-z\fP\&. Exit status: 0 if at least one join was performed, or 1 otherwise.
.sp
Because Unix uses NUL as the string terminator, passing the output of \fBstring join0\fP as an \fIargument\fP to a command (via a \fI\%command substitution\fP) won\(aqt actually work. Fish will pass the correct bytes along, but the command won\(aqt be able to tell where the argument ends. This is a limitation of Unix\(aq argument passing.

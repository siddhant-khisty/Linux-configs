.TH "COMMAND" "1" "Mar 25, 2023" "3.6" "fish-shell"
.SH NAME
command \- run a program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcommand\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fICOMMANDNAME\fP [\fIARG\fP \&...]]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcommand\fP forces the shell to execute the program \fICOMMANDNAME\fP and ignore any functions or builtins with the same name.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP or \fB\-\-all\fP
Prints all \fICOMMAND\fP found in \fI\%PATH\fP, in the order found.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-query\fP
Silence output and print nothing, setting only exit status.
Implies \fB\-\-search\fP\&.
For compatibility, this is also \fB\-\-quiet\fP (deprecated).
.TP
\fB\-v\fP (or \fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-search\fP)
Prints the external command that would be executed, or prints nothing if no file with the specified name could be found in \fI\%PATH\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
Displays help about using this command.
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the \fB\-v\fP option, \fBcommand\fP treats every argument as a separate command to look up and sets the exit status to 0 if any of the specified commands were found, or 127 if no commands could be found. \fB\-\-quiet\fP used with \fB\-v\fP prevents commands being printed, like \fBtype \-q\fP\&.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
\fBcommand ls\fP executes the \fBls\fP program, even if an \fBls\fP function also exists.
\fBcommand \-s ls\fP prints the path to the \fBls\fP program.
\fBcommand \-q git; and command git log\fP runs \fBgit log\fP only if \fBgit\fP exists.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpath\fP performs operations on paths.
.sp
PATH arguments are taken from the command line unless standard input is connected to a pipe or a file, in which case they are read from standard input, one PATH per line. It is an error to supply PATH arguments on both the command line and on standard input.
.sp
Arguments starting with \fB\-\fP are normally interpreted as switches; \fB\-\-\fP causes the following arguments not to be treated as switches even if they begin with \fB\-\fP\&. Switches and required arguments are recognized only on the command line.
.sp
When a path starts with \fB\-\fP, \fBpath filter\fP and \fBpath normalize\fP will prepend \fB\&./\fP on output to avoid it being interpreted as an option otherwise, so it\(aqs safe to pass path\(aqs output to other commands that can handle relative paths.
.sp
All subcommands accept a \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-\-quiet\fP switch, which suppresses the usual output but exits with the documented status. In this case these commands will quit early, without reading all of the available input.
.sp
All subcommands also accept a \fB\-Z\fP or \fB\-\-null\-out\fP switch, which makes them print output separated with NUL instead of newlines. This is for further processing, e.g. passing to another \fBpath\fP, or \fBxargs \-0\fP\&. This is not recommended when the output goes to the terminal or a command substitution.
.sp
All subcommands also accept a \fB\-z\fP or \fB\-\-null\-in\fP switch, which makes them accept arguments from stdin separated with NULL\-bytes. Since Unix paths can\(aqt contain NULL, that makes it possible to handle all possible paths and read input from e.g. \fBfind \-print0\fP\&. If arguments are given on the commandline this has no effect. This should mostly be unnecessary since \fBpath\fP automatically starts splitting on NULL if one appears in the first PATH_MAX bytes, PATH_MAX being the operating system\(aqs maximum length for a path plus a NULL byte.
.sp
Some subcommands operate on the paths as strings and so work on nonexistent paths, while others need to access the paths themselves and so filter out nonexistent paths.
.sp
The following subcommands are available.

\fBpath basename\fP returns the last path component of the given path, by removing the directory prefix and removing trailing slashes. In other words, it is the part that is not the dirname. For files you might call it the \(dqfilename\(dq.
.sp
It returns 0 if there was a basename, i.e. if the path wasn\(aqt empty or just slashes.

\fBpath extension\fP returns the extension of the given path. This is the part after (and including) the last \(dq.\(dq, unless that \(dq.\(dq followed a \(dq/\(dq or the basename is \(dq.\(dq or \(dq..\(dq, in which case there is no extension and an empty line is printed.
.sp
If the filename ends in a \(dq.\(dq, only a \(dq.\(dq is printed.

It returns 0 if there was an extension.

\fBpath filter\fP returns all of the given paths that match the given checks. In all cases, the paths need to exist, nonexistent paths are always filtered.
.sp
The available filters are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-t\fP or \fB\-\-type\fP with the options: \(dqdir\(dq, \(dqfile\(dq, \(dqlink\(dq, \(dqblock\(dq, \(dqchar\(dq, \(dqfifo\(dq and \(dqsocket\(dq, in which case the path needs to be a directory, file, link, block device, character device, named pipe or socket, respectively.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-f\fP and \fB\-l\fP are short for \fB\-\-type=dir\fP, \fB\-\-type=file\fP and \fB\-\-type=link\fP, respectively. There are no shortcuts for the other types.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-perm\fP with the options: \(dqread\(dq, \(dqwrite\(dq, and \(dqexec\(dq, as well as \(dqsuid\(dq, \(dqsgid\(dq, \(dquser\(dq (referring to the path owner) and \(dqgroup\(dq (referring to the path\(aqs group), in which case the path needs to have all of the given permissions for the current user.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-x\fP are short for \fB\-\-perm=read\fP, \fB\-\-perm=write\fP and \fB\-\-perm=exec\fP, respectively. There are no shortcuts for the other permissions.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the path needs to be \fIany\fP of the given types, but have \fIall\fP of the given permissions. This is because having a path that is both writable and executable makes sense, but having a path that is both a directory and a file doesn\(aqt. Links will count as the type of the linked\-to file, so links to files count as files, links to directories count as directories.
.sp
The filter options can either be given as multiple options, or comma\-separated \- \fBpath filter \-t dir,file\fP or \fBpath filter \-\-type dir \-\-type file\fP are equivalent.
.sp
With \fB\-\-invert\fP, the meaning of the filtering is inverted \- any path that wouldn\(aqt pass (including by not existing) passes, and any path that would pass fails.
.sp
When a path starts with \fB\-\fP, \fBpath filter\fP will prepend \fB\&./\fP to avoid it being interpreted as an option otherwise.
.sp
It returns 0 if at least one path passed the filter.
.sp
\fBpath is\fP is shorthand for \fBpath filter \-q\fP, i.e. just checking without producing output, see \fI\%The is subcommand\fP\&.

\fBpath mtime\fP returns the last modification time (\(dqmtime\(dq in unix jargon) of the given paths, in seconds since the unix epoch (the beginning of the 1st of January 1970).
.sp
With \fB\-\-relative\fP (or \fB\-R\fP), it prints the number of seconds since the modification time. It only reads the current time once at start, so in case multiple paths are given the times are all relative to the \fIstart\fP of \fBpath mtime \-R\fP running.
.sp
If you want to know if a file is newer or older than another file, consider using \fBtest \-nt\fP instead. See \fI\%the test documentation\fP\&.
.sp
It returns 0 if reading mtime for any path succeeded.

\fBpath normalize\fP returns the normalized versions of all paths. That means it squashes duplicate \(dq/\(dq (except for two leading \(dq//\(dq), collapses \(dq../\(dq with earlier components and removes \(dq.\(dq components.
.sp
Unlike \fBrealpath\fP or \fBpath resolve\fP, it does not make the paths absolute. It also does not resolve any symlinks. As such it can operate on non\-existent paths.
.sp
Because it operates on paths as strings and doesn\(aqt resolve symlinks, it works sort of like \fBpwd \-L\fP and \fBcd\fP\&. E.g. \fBpath normalize link/..\fP will return \fB\&.\fP, just like \fBcd link; cd ..\fP would return to the current directory. For a physical view of the filesystem, see \fBpath resolve\fP\&.
.sp
Leading \(dq./\(dq components are usually removed. But when a path starts with \fB\-\fP, \fBpath normalize\fP will add it instead to avoid confusion with options.
.sp
It returns 0 if any normalization was done, i.e. any given path wasn\(aqt in canonical form.

\fBpath resolve\fP returns the normalized, physical and absolute versions of all paths. That means it resolves symlinks and does what \fBpath normalize\fP does: it squashes duplicate \(dq/\(dq, collapses \(dq../\(dq with earlier components and removes \(dq.\(dq components. Then it turns that path into the absolute path starting from the filesystem root \(dq/\(dq.
.sp
It is similar to \fBrealpath\fP, as it creates the \(dqreal\(dq, canonical version of the path. However, for paths that can\(aqt be resolved, e.g. if they don\(aqt exist or form a symlink loop, it will resolve as far as it can and normalize the rest.
.sp
Because it resolves symlinks, it works sort of like \fBpwd \-P\fP\&. E.g. \fBpath resolve link/..\fP will return the parent directory of what the link points to, just like \fBcd link; cd (pwd \-P)/..\fP would go to it. For a logical view of the filesystem, see \fBpath normalize\fP\&.
.sp
It returns 0 if any normalization or resolution was done, i.e. any given path wasn\(aqt in canonical form.

\fBpath change\-extension\fP returns the given paths, with their extension changed to the given new extension. The extension is the part after (and including) the last \(dq.\(dq, unless that \(dq.\(dq followed a \(dq/\(dq or the basename is \(dq.\(dq or \(dq..\(dq, in which case there is no previous extension and the new one is simply added.
.sp
If the extension is empty, any previous extension is stripped, along with the \(dq.\(dq. This is, of course, the inverse of \fBpath extension\fP\&.
.sp
One leading dot on the extension is ignored, so \(dq.mp3\(dq and \(dqmp3\(dq are treated the same.

\fBpath sort\fP returns the given paths in sorted order. They are sorted in the same order as globs \- alphabetically, but with runs of numerical digits compared numerically.
.sp
With \fB\-\-reverse\fP or \fB\-r\fP the sort is reversed.
.sp
With \fB\-\-key=\fP only the given part of the path is compared, e.g. \fB\-\-key=dirname\fP causes only the dirname to be compared, \fB\-\-key=basename\fP only the basename and \fB\-\-key=path\fP causes the entire path to be compared (this is the default).
.sp
With \fB\-\-unique\fP or \fB\-u\fP the sort is deduplicated, meaning only the first of a run that have the same key is kept. So if you are sorting by basename, then only the first of each basename is used.
.sp
The sort used is stable, so sorting first by basename and then by dirname works and causes the files to be grouped according to directory.
.sp
It currently returns 0 if it was given any paths.
